# Iron-Condor-Calculator
Condor Calculator is a mobile-first options trading tool designed to make Iron Condor strategies easy to visualize, understand, and evaluate.

Most investing and brokerage apps focus on order execution, not education or clarity. While they technically support multi-leg options strategies, they often make iron condors difficult to reason about—forcing traders to mentally calculate risk, reward, and break-even points without clear visual feedback.

Condor Calculator solves this by giving traders a visual, interactive way to build an iron condor and instantly see how changes to strike prices affect:

- Max profit

- Max loss

- Break-even range

- Net credit received

- Profit/Loss across price ranges at expiration

Users can select a stock ticker, adjust call and put strikes using intuitive sliders, and watch the payoff graph update in real time. This turns an otherwise abstract strategy into something concrete and easy to reason about—especially for newer options traders.

Why this project exists

Iron condors are popular for their defined risk and high-probability setups, but they are often misunderstood because:

- Risk and reward are spread across four legs

- Broker UIs prioritize trading over explanation

- Payoff diagrams are buried or non-interactive

Condor Calculator puts visual understanding first, making it easier to explore, learn, and validate iron condor strategies before placing a trade.

Project goals

- Simplify iron condor analysis

- Make risk/reward instantly understandable

- Provide a clean, mobile-first experience

- Serve as both a learning tool and a practical calculator

This project is ideal for traders who want clarity before execution—and for developers interested in building intuitive fintech UX around complex financial concepts.
