# Iron-Condor-Calculator
Condor Calculator is a mobile-first options trading tool designed to make Iron Condor strategies easy to visualize, understand, and evaluate.

Most investing and brokerage apps focus on order execution, not education or clarity. While they technically support multi-leg options strategies, they often make iron condors difficult to reason about—forcing traders to mentally calculate risk, reward, and break-even points without clear visual feedback.

Condor Calculator solves this by giving traders a visual, interactive way to build an iron condor and instantly see how changes to strike prices affect:

Max profit

Max loss

Break-even range

Net credit received

Profit/Loss across price ranges at expiration

Users can select a stock ticker, adjust call and put strikes using intuitive sliders, and watch the payoff graph update in real time. This turns an otherwise abstract strategy into something concrete and easy to reason about—especially for newer options traders.
